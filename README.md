# Air Pollution Analysis in Serbian Cities

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on air pollution data from various cities in Serbia. 

The primary tools used for this analysis are Python, with a heavy reliance on NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and processing. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the European Environment Agency, and it was processed to identify the most polluted cities in Serbia based on various air pollutants.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to identify the top 3 most polluted cities in Serbia by analyzing several air pollutants over a specific time span. To achieve this, we performed the following key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Refinement:** We started by cleaning and refining the original dataset. This involved removing irrelevant cities, pollutants, and years to ensure that our analysis focuses on meaningful data.

2. **Calculation of Pollution Values:** We then calculated pollution values per city for each year span. This calculation is crucial for providing valuable insights into the air quality of different cities in Serbia.

## Key Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** The project is primarily implemented in Python, a versatile programming language.
- **NumPy:** NumPy is used for numerical operations and efficient array handling, making data manipulation more convenient.
- **Pandas:** Pandas is instrumental in data analysis and manipulation, enabling us to work with structured data effectively.
